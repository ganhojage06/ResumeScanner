# Drawbacks 
Currently, the application only works with PDFs and does not support images or scanned PDFs with images. Since I changed my old system, I need to set up MS Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, which takes around 7 hours to install. Rest assured, it will also work with images, as the code has already been tested for this functionality


# Libraries Used for API
1. pytesseract
2. Openai
3. PyPDF2
4. pdf2image
5. Django


# Disclaimer
1. I cannot share the backend code, as I conducted extensive research and development to build it
2. The only chargeable component is the OpenAI API key, which is free for limited usage but incurs charges based on user usage after that limit
